                Barauni Refinery a state owned oil Refinery of IndianOil was dedicated to the nation in1965. Established in 1964, on the Northern banks of holy Ganga, at Barauni, on the periphery of the district town Begusarai, Bihar. Situated 125 km from Patna, it is also the point where two important railways meet – the Eastern Railways and North Eastern Railways. It was built in collaboration with the Soviet Union with limited participation from Romania, at a cost of ~Rs 49.4 Crore and went on stream in 1964.
                <br> <br>
                The Refinery has gone a long way over the years, starting from a crude processing capacity of 1.0 MMTPA (AVU-I) of sweet crude from Assam oil fields. It has steadily expanded its capacity to 3.0 MMTPA with AVU-II and AU-III. Further, with the revamp of AVU-I & II in 1990 and AU-III in 2000, crude processing capability was increased to 4.2 MMTPA till 2000 and then to current level of 6.0 MMTPA in 2002 enabling the processing of high sulphur crudes through Barauni Expansion Project (BXP). Residue Fluidized Catalytic Cracker Unit (RFCCU), Diesel Hydro Treating Unit (DHDT), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU), Amine Re-generation Unit (ARU) and Hydrogen Generation Unit (HGU) are some of the major units.

        </div>
        <p class="text">
            The refinery division of an oil refinery processes crude oil into valuable petroleum products through the following steps:<br>

            Crude Oil Reception: Crude oil is received and stored, undergoing preliminary testing.<br>

                Pre-Treatment: Impurities like water, sediments, and salts are removed from the crude oil.<br>

                    Distillation: The crude oil is heated to separate it into different fractions based on boiling points.<br>

                    Conversion Processes: Certain fractions undergo additional processes to modify their molecular structure and improve product quality.<br>

                Treatment and Blending: Impurities are removed, and different fractions are blended to meet product specifications.<br>

            Product Distribution: Refined petroleum products are stored and transported to various markets.<br>

        Throughout the process, quality control measures and environmental regulations are followed to ensure high-quality products and minimize environmental impact.<br>
